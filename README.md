# Crossbar.io IoT Cookbook

The Crossbar.io IoT Cookbook is a collection of Internet-of-things, embedded hardware-software demo projects and examples based on Crossbar.io and Autobahn.

All software parts are built from our 60+ Crossbar.io and Autobahn [Docker base images](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar-docker/blob/master/IMAGES.md) we publish on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crossbario/).

All of the code is open-source and liberally licensed under the [MIT LICENSE](LICENSE).

Use it as a quick start for whatever project you start, open-source or commercial!

# Crossbar.io IoT Cookbook

The Crossbar.io IoT Cookbook is a collection of Internet-of-Things, embedded hardware-software demo projects and examples based on the [Crossbar.io WAMP router](http://crossbar.io) and the  [Autobahn WAMP client libraries](http://crossbar.io/autobahn).

Software parts are built from our 60+ Crossbar.io and Autobahn [Docker base images](https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar-docker/blob/master/IMAGES.md) we publish on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/crossbario/), and the workflow which we document is Docker based.

All components connect to our public Crossbar.io demo instance. This is for convenience when initially quickly testing things. For actual development as well as deployment, you need to use your own Crossbar.io router (which is not difficult to set up).

All code is open-source and liberally licensed under the [MIT LICENSE](LICENSE).

Use it as a quick start for whatever project you start, open-source or commercial!

> While all recipes here use Docker for ease of use, the code can be adapted (and trivially so generally) to work non-containerized.
